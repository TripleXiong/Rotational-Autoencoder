# Rotational-Autoencoder
Use MNIST dataset, and rotate each image by random angles. 

1. Generate training data from MNIST dataset and rotate each image by a random angle
2. Build fully connected baseline (linear) model and Convolutional Neural Network model
3. Implement CNN layers with upsampling and maxpooling functions
4. MSE loss for baseline model converged at 0.024, MSE loss for CNN model convergered at 0.022

Used Pytorch with CUDA, GPU parallel programming.
